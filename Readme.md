## Compile and Run
The best way to compile, link and run it is to set up a correct build environment . But for a simple tutorial like this, itâ€™s enough to just create a build directory and build from there. This command takes care of all of that in one line:

```shell script
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && ./mainwindow
```
